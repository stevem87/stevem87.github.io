### CPSC 120

* Lab 3

    Lab 3, part 1 was one of my favorite labs because it helped give me practice with using different equations. It also helped give me more practice with character imputs. We were able to successfully initialize the function.

    Lab 8, part 1 was another favorite lab because we learned how to incorporate strings. It also showed us how to use arguments. We were able to use logical operators in the if statement.

    Lab 10, part 1 was a favorite because we were able to integrate bools. We were able to use assignment operators. Lastly, we integrated a separate file.
